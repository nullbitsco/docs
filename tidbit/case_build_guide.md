⚠️ **Important!** Notes marked with this icon are crucial, so be sure to read them carefully before moving on.

⚠️ **Stop!** If at any point during your build you find yourself confused, stuck, not sure whether something you're doing is right, or not sure what to do next, stop and ask! On average, questions are answered on Discord or via email in less than a few hours. Better to ask questions that might feel silly than to make a mistake!

Steps marked [OPTIONAL] aren&#39;t required for the base kit, but may be needed depending on what you choose to include in your build.

## 1. Remove backplate screws and feet/bumpons

If your TIDBIT is already assembled, remove the 6 M2x3mm screws holding the backplate on the board, along with the 2 M2x10mm screws and standoffs holding on the top acrylic guard. These screws will be replaced with M2x6mm screws included with the case kit. Remove any feet or bumpons from the backplate.

If your TIDBIT is not yet fully assembled, do not fasten the backplate on with the M2x3mm screws.

## 2. Note TRRS orientation and screw in M2x12mm standoffs into bottom layer

The bottom acrylic layer has a cutout for the TRRS jack. It should match the TRRS location on your TIDBIT (on the left side under the MCU). Peel and remove the acrylic backing material from the acrylic layer, and wipe it clean with a microfiber cloth or rubbing alcohol.

Using 8x M2x6mm screws, attach the 8 M2x12mm standoffs to the bottom acrylic layer. Be careful to keep the TRRS cutout on the correct side of the board while screwing in the standoffs. Tighten just past hand-tight.

## 3. Screw TIDBIT board into bottom layer

Wipe the bottom layer and the backplate of the TIDBIT clean with a microfiber cloth or rubbing alcohol. Using 6x M2x6mm screws, attach the bottom acrylic layer to the assembled TIDBIT board. Make sure that the M2x12mm standoffs are pointing toward the top of the TIDBIT (in the same direction as the switches and keycaps face). The TRRS jack should sit inside the TRRS cutout.

⚠️ **Important!** The TIDBIT attaches to the bottom layer of the case with the inner acrylic spacer and backplate still on. The total thickness will be incorrect if the backplate is left off, and the screws won't tighten. Bumpons must also be removed for this reason.

## 4. Stack lower-middle acrylic layers

Peel and remove the acrylic backing material from the two 4mm thick lower-middle acrylic layers, and wipe them clean with a microfiber cloth or rubbing alcohol. Stack the two layers on the standoffs, making sure to align the break in the acrylic with the TRRS jack.

## 5. Stack upper-middle acrylic layers

Peel and remove the acrylic backing material from the two 3mm thick upper-middle acrylic layers, and wipe them clean with a microfiber cloth or rubbing alcohol. Stack the two layers on the standoffs, making sure to align the break in the acrylic with the USB jack on the MCU.

## 6. Stack and fasten top acrylic layer

Peel and remove the acrylic backing material from the top acrylic layer, and wipe it clean with a microfiber cloth or rubbing alcohol. Stack the top layer on the standoff on top of the middle layers, making sure to align the cutout in the acrylic with the USB jack on the MCU. Screw it into the standoffs using 8x M2x10mm screws.

## 7. Attach bumpons and wipe clean

Stick the 4 included bumpons on the bottom sie of the bottom layer, one on each corner. Wipe the top, bottom, and edges of the case clean with a microfiber cloth or rubbing alcohol.
