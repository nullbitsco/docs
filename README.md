# nullbits-docs
Online documentation (build guides, user manuals, etc) for nullbits products. 

## What happened to the PDF guides?
They worked fine, but were getting tedious to update. We decided to move to markdown build guides and instructions that are hosted on GitHub so that they were easier to update, and also so that people in the community could propose changes and additions via PRs.

## Contributing
If you have a suggestion or change in mind, clone this repo and make the changes in a local branch. Then, open a PR that includes a summary of what you think should be changed and why. 

## Translations
Currently, the build guides only exist in english. If you are fluent in another language, and would like to translate a build guide (for example, as you are building and following along), that would be fantastic. Reach out or open a PR if you might have interest in doing so.
