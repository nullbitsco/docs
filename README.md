## Contributing
If you have a suggestion or change in mind, clone this repo and make the changes in a local branch. Then, open a PR that includes a summary of what you think should be changed and why. 

## Translations
Currently, the build guides only exist in english. If you are fluent in another language, and would like to translate a build guide (for example, as you are building and following along), that would be fantastic. Reach out or open a PR if you might have interest in doing so.
